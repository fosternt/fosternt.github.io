I am an assistant professor at the <a href="https://usnwc.edu" target="_blank">Naval War College</a>. Previously I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Technology and International Security at the <a href="https://igcc.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">UC Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation</a> in Washington, DC. I received my Ph.D. in <a href="http://politics.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Politics</a> from <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton University</a> in 2021.

My main research interests lie in the intersection of grand strategy and domestic politics.  In particular, I study how revisionist powers leverage diverse tools of statecraft to shape their adversaries' domestic politics to their strategic advantage.  I examine the mechanisms behind the use of influence and information operations by combining qualitative, experimental, and computational methods.  Through the generous support of a Minerva Research Initiative 2022-2025 grant, my latest research project unlocks the mechanisms through which Russian and Chinese information operations shape public opinion and political behaviors in target states.

Another strand of my research focuses on democratization and contentious politics in the Middle East and North Africa. My first book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mauritania-Struggle-Democracy-Studies-Africa/dp/1935049305" target="_blank"><i>Mauritania: The Struggle for Democracy</i></a> (2010, <a href="https://www.rienner.com/title/Mauritania_The_Struggle_for_Democracy" target="_blank">Lynne Rienner</a>), centers on electoral autocracy and the simulation of democratization as part of patron-client relations in international politics.
