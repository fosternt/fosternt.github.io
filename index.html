I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="http://politics.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Politics</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton University</a>, specializing in international relations.

My main research interests lie in the intersection of grand strategy and domestic politics, with a focus on hybrid conflicts and the foreign policy of revisionist states. I study the mechanisms of polarization behind revisionist states' strategic use of influence operations and disinformation using a mix of qualitative, experimental, and computational methods.

My job market paper, "<a href="http://j.mp/nFoster" target="_blank">Polarization for Paralysis: How Revisionist States Weaponize Information to Shift Foreign Political Behaviors</a>," studies how Russian state-sponsored news content polarizes voters in the Baltics to paralyze policy decision-making in the target states. An earlier version of this paper was selected as the 2020 Timothy E. Cook Best Graduate Student Paper Honorable Mention by the American Political Science Association's Political Communication Section.

Another strand of my research focuses on democratization and contentious politics in the Middle East and North Africa. My first book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mauritania-Struggle-Democracy-Studies-Africa/dp/1935049305" target="_blank"><i>Mauritania: The Struggle for Democracy</i></a> (2010, <a href="https://www.rienner.com/title/Mauritania_The_Struggle_for_Democracy" target="_blank">Lynne Rienner</a>), centers on electoral autocracy and the simulation of democratization.
